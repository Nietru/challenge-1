# Challenge-1: Horiseon Marketing

## Description

My motivation for this webpage was to leave the code more comprehensive and consolidated than how I had received it. I wanted to acquire new skills in HTML semantics, while completing the acceptance criteria to the best of my ability.

I built off this project to make a more accesible version for the user without changing the overall appearance for the client.

I solved the accessibility issue with a descriptive webpage title, fully functioning links, alt attributes for all of the visuals within the HTML file, and a sequential order for all of the heading attributes. 

I learned that there are many different ways to make different code have the same result, that there is a difference between a descriptive title and a title website, and that heading attributes need to go from h1 through h6 tags from the top/beginning of the HTML file to the bottom/end. Thinking of heading attributes in the HTML file as levels of importance, rather than a size styling, helped me understand why we go in order from h1 through h6.
