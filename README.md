# Challenge-1: Horiseon Marketing

## Description

My motivation for this webpage was to leave the code better than how i received it, and to acquire new skills in HTML semantics, while completing the acceptance criteria to the best of my ability.

I built off this project to make a more accesible version for the user without changing the overall appearance for the client.

I solved the accessibility issue with a descriptive webpage title, full functioning links, alt attributes for all of the visuals within the HTML file, and a sequential order for all of the heading attributes. 

I learned that there are many different ways to make different code have the same result. I also learned that there is a difference between a descriptive title and a title website, and that heading attributes need to go from largest to smallest from the top to the bottom of the HTML file.
